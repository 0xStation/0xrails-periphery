# GroupOS Core Contracts ðŸ§™

_A Solidity framework for creating complex and evolving onchain structures._

**GroupOS** is a Web3 toolkit to activate members, distribute rewards and measure growth by providing:

  - *Flexibility* 
    - Our infrastructure and developer tooling allows for maximal customizability in each step of the user journey. From proof-of-humanhood and KYC mechanisms to custom branding and front-end, we look to power application experiences in the background.
  - *Attributability* 
    - token networks need to be user-centric (members including both people and bots!) with access to data to understand engagement and activities.
  - *Modularity* 
    - Our developer kit fits seamlessly into and alongside existing workflows and applications. Developers can bring their existing contracts or create new ones with us.
  - *Ease-of-use*
    - From our APIs/SDKs to our no-code dashboard, we seek beauty in simplicity and ease of use.
