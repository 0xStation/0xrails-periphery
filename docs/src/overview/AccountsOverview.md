# Account Abstraction Overview

An account is the atomic unit of a network: a player of games, a member of a DAO, an users of a protocol.

GroupOS‚Äôs Accounts are ERC-6551 and ERC-4337 compliant smart contract wallets, offering full programmability and extensibility.

We provide out-of-the-box toolkit to gaslessly onboard and activate users to applications.

## Account Abstraction: ERC4337

[ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) is a new standard built on top of the EVM that enhances smart contract wallets on Ethereum-based blockchains. Commonly referred to as ‚ÄúAccount Abstraction,‚Äù ERC-4337 allows developers to create customized and embedded experiences that eliminates the dependencies on EOAs to initiate transactions and pay for gas. 

In short, ERC-4337 makes smart contract wallets programmable. Developers can integrate wallet functionality into their user interfaces using these APIs, allowing them to experiment and customize the wallet experience for their applications.

## Tokenbound Accounts: ERC6551

[ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551), token-bound accounts (TBAs), builds upon the ERC-721 standard by introducing smart contract capabilities to NFTs. Every NFT will be able to own ETH and other ERC20s, 721, 1155 tokens, and be associated with onchain attestations. Using digital outfits and items, the standard can power new use cases like NFT loyalty programs, PFPs as on-chain identities, and new game mechanics.

## ERC4337 ü§ù ERC6551
We recognize the genre-defining possibility when the two standards are combined. The new paradigm can change the way users onboard and engage onchain. While ERC-6551 creates a visual representation and a unifying source of truth that fosters a sense of psychological ownership, account abstraction gives dApp developers and networks flexibility to automate operations and rewards with smart contracts programmatically.
