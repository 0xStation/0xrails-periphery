# Security

Safety and security of the GroupOS protocol is our utmost priority. Station dedicates significant resources to ensure GroupOS design is bulletproof. Deep security considerations for new smart contract code are emphasized at implementation time, which is when context is most clear. In addition, protocol features are thoroughly tested with fuzzing and an eye for edge cases.

# Audits

GroupOS has recently completed a formal security audit by [Sayfer Security](https://sayfer.io/). Station chose Sayfer to conduct our security audit [because they are one of only seven audit firms approved by MetaMask to be an approved MetaMask Snap auditor.](https://sayfer.io/blog/auditing-metamask-snaps/)

The audit report is published and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/0xStation/groupos/blob/docs/audits/Sayfer/Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20Report%20for%20Station.pdf)
